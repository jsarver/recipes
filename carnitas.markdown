# Homemade Carnitas

## Ingredients

* 4 pounds (or 2 kg) pork butt (or shoulder)
* 3-4 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon pepper
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano (or Mexican oregano)
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 large brown or white onion, cut into wedges
* 8 cloves garlic, smashed
* 2 limes, juiced
* 2 large oranges, juiced (or 3/4 cup natural orange juice)
* 3/4 cup Original coke (Mexican coke is ideal)
* 2 bay leaves

## Directions
Combine everything and cook on low for 8-10 hours. Donâ€™t discard liquid!
Place on baking sheet, cover with 1 cup of liquid and broil. Watch closely!
The recipe recommended broiling for 15 minutes but I only broiled for 5, any longer and ours would have burned. Enjoy guys!
