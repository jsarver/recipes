# Peposo (a black pepper based stew)

## Ingredients
* Short rib (bone in)
* A bottle of Chianti
* a ludicrous quantity of pepper
* Salt
* tomato paste
* a couple herbs
* rice

## Directions
* Smash/crush some garlic, mix with tomato paste and liberally smear onto the short rib.Buy whole black pepper corns.
* Crush some using a cutting board and skillet, maybe 2 tablespoons for 3 pounds? I've never measured, and usually add ground pepper too.
* Put the beef in a pot/saute pan, add pepper on top. 
* Poke in some herbs/ bag leaves/whatever if you have it. 
* Pour in most of a bottle of Chianti. 
* Set it on high heat
* turn down as low as you can right before boil and cover
* Leave for 2 hours. Optionally flip beef pieces and if possible, slide the bone out. 
* If you take the bones out, leave them in the pot. 
* Cook for another hour-hour and a half. It's basically impossible to overdo this stuff,
* Don't stop until it's basically falling apart when you touch it. Remove the herbs, beef, and bones. 
* Uncover and turn the heat back as high as it will go. Reduce until it's nice and thick or it's half the volume it was. 
* Put rice/polenta on a plate in a pretty shape. Stack some meat chunks on top. 
* Pour over your sauce (you might need to whisk it to combat separation).
